# Introduction

This is my personal neovim configuration for Linux with various plugins configured. it evolves as I learn more about neovim and become more proficient in using neovim. <br />
I wouldn't recommend cloning this repo and replace your own config, especially on other platforms since some configs for only for linux! <br />
Good configurations are personal, built over time with a lot of polish.

# Install and setup

Just run install.sh to install it on linux(untested on other platforms)

# Plugins

+ Plugin management via [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).
